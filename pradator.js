/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	This is my take on the UA:Playtest Ranger past level 5. It made reference to using a spell slot to activate Primeval Awareness yet included no spell lists or progression tables.
	To flesh out the class I gave the Predator Ranger access to abilities at different levels that are spells that don't require components (your environment is your component) that can only be used once per short or long rest.
	If someone has better skill-spells in mind, I'd also like to hear about it. I picked ones that were very specific to hunting down prey and slowly putting it out of its misery. 
	Which is in line with the tactics of the Komodo dragon, thus I added the Komodo Dragon as the Companion Spirit unique to the Predator Path.
	
	All Komodo dragons have to do in real life is bite once and walk away. Recent findings have revealed that the Komodo dragon only uses Poison and Tearing of flesh, 
	and not a Necrotic combination of Poison and Disease ridden bacteria as previously thought. So if you need a more powerful Companion Spirit, also give it immunity to Disease and make the damage type Necrotic instead of just a Poison status.
	
	I've added Scavenger's Tools instead of using Leatherworking (as suggested in the Lizardfolk writeup, because I couldn't see using stamping and punch tools to make bone darts. I imagine a Scavenger's Tools consisting of implements for 
	scraping, sharpening, filing, cutting, weaving (rope and tying skin to frames), etc. It works well with the guerilla background trait too. 
	
	I can be contacted on reddit u/stanseas.

	Sheet:		v13.00.00 (2018-??-??) [identical to v12.999 syntax, except v12.999 uses 'borrow' for the burrow speed]
